- Getting the visualizations as simplified as possible.

## MY EXPERIENCE :
The dataset was extremely low quality and untidy in terms of its structure.Identifying the cleaning tasks was quite a new experince and had a lot to learn interms of managing the null values,categorical variables etc.All together,It was quite challenging to ask questions related to the datset and then finding out the features that may answer the questions.Visualization was also quite hectic and needed a lot of efforts.Inspite of all these challenges the insights revealed at the end were definately worth it.
